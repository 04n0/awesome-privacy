export const aboutOurData = `
All data is stored in 
[\`awesome-privacy.yml\`](https://github.com/lissy93/awesome-privacy/blob/main/awesome-privacy.yml).

This file is then pulled into the website at build-time, and also used to generate
the repositories README file.
We use this method in the interest of transparency and data integrity,
as Git makes it possible to maintain a full log of what was changed, when, by who and why.

### Augmention
The data is augmented with some extra info, to add additional context to each service.
The aim of this is to give you a broader picture of each listing, to help you make a more informed decision.

	- Including policy and terms of service links, postives + negatives and privacy score
	- <small>Via [ToS;DR](https://tosdr.org/)</small>
- **GitHub** - To fetch info about each project's source code
	- Including author & contributors, creation & last updated date, languages, license and star count

- **Android App** - To fetch privacy info about each project's Android app
	- Including permissions, trackers, privacy score and metdata
	- <small>Via [Exodus Privacy](https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/)</small>
- **iOS App** - To fetch info about each project's iOS app
	- Including app size, rating, publish/update date, author and screenshots
	- <small>Via [Apple App Store](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store)</small>
- **Docker** - To fetch info about each project's Docker image (if it's self-hosted)
	- Including supported architectures, run command, pull count, last updated and config options
	- <small>Via [Portainer-Templates](https://portainer-templates.as93.net/) and the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) API</small>
- **Website** - To fetch privacy info about each project's website
	- Including SSL chain, WHOIS, server location, blacklist check and a screenshot
	- <small>Via [Web-Check](https://web-check.xyz/)</small>
- **Socials** - To fetch info about each project's social media presence
	- Including follower count, post frequency, engagement and a screenshot

### API
We also have a free, no-auth, CORS-enabled RESR API,
which you can use to access Awesome Privacy's data programmatically,
or to build your own apps on top of it.

The [Swagger Spec](api) outlines all endpoints, usage and examples.

Use our public instance, at: \`https://api.awesome-privacy.xyz\` or [self-host your own](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy/tree/main/api)

export const projectRequirements = `
For software to be included in this list, it must meet the following requirements: 

- **Privacy Respecting**
	- The project must respect users privacy, not collect more data than necessary, and store info securely
	- For hosted services, the project must have a clear privacy policy
	- The user must remain in full control of their data, and be able to delete it at any time
- **Secure**
  - The software must be secure by default, without requiring additional configuration
  - There should be no current, critical security issues
  - The handling of past issues must have been prompt, transparent and effective
  - Ideally hosted services should have been security audited, with the report published publicly
- **Open Source**
	- The full source code should be released under an open source license
	- Ideally it should be possible for the user to build and run/deploy the software themselves from source
- **Actively Maintained**
  - The developers should address dependency updates and security patches in a timely manner
  - Ideally the source should have been updated within the last 12 months 
- **Transparent**
  - It should be clear who is behind the project, what their motives are, and what (if any) the funding model is
  - For hosted solutions, the privacy policy should clearly state what data is collected, how it's used and how long it's stored
- **Ethical**
  - Must not suppress free speech, discriminate or disregard any human rights
- **Relevant**
	- The software must be relevant, and fit into one of the existing categories
- **Functional**
	- Must be fully functional, and not just a concept or idea
	- A stable (non-alpha/beta) release is required at a minimum
	- Must be accessible to the general public, and not just a select group of people
	- If technical knowledge is required to run it, the software must be well documented

_There may be some exceptions, but these would need to be fully justified, reviewed
by the community, and the drawbacks / anti-features must be clearly listed along-side the software.
Usually these entries go within the "Notable Mentions" section instead._
