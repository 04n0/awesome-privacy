          LessPass is a little different, since it generates your passwords using a hash

          It omits the need for you to ever need to store or sync your passwords. They
          have apps for all the common platforms and a CLI, but you can also self-host it.

      wordOfWarning: >
        Where possible, choose a cross-platform and well established encryption method,
        so that you are never faced with not being able to access your files using your current system.<br>
        Although well-established encryption methods are usually very secure,
        if the password is not strong, then an adversary may be able to gain access to your files,
        with a powerful enough GPU.
        If your system is compromised, then the password may also be able to be
        skimmed with a keylogger or other similar malware, so take care to follow
        good basic security practices

          consisting of a symmetrical and an asymmetrical algorithm (with 128 bit AES, and
          2048 bit RSA). This causes compatibility issues when communicating with contacts

      intro: >
        Email clients are the programs used to interact with the mail server.
        For hosted email, then the web and mobile clients provided by your email
        service are usually adequate, and may be the most secure option.
        For self-hosted email, you will need to install and configure mail clients for web, desktop or mobile.
        A benefit of using an IMAP client, is that you will always have an offline backup of all email messages
        (which can then be encrypted and archived), and many applications let you aggregate multiple mailboxes
        for convenience. Desktop mail clients are not vulnerable to the common browser attacks, that their web
        app counterparts are.

          Easy-to-deploy, self-hosted team collaboration platform with stable, feature-rich
          cross-platform client apps. The UI is fast, good looking and intuitive, so very
          little technical experience is needed for users of the platform. Rocket.Chat's
          feature set is similar to Slack's, making it a good replacement for any team
          looking to have greater control over their data.

        url: https://retroshare.cc/
        description: |
          Secure group communications, with the option to be used over Tor or I2P. Fast
          intuitive group and 1-to-1 chats with text and rich media using decentralized
          chat rooms, with a mail feature for delivering messages to offline contacts.
          A channels feature makes it possible for members of different teams to stay
          up-to-date with each other, and to share files. Also includes built-in forums,
          link aggregations, file sharing and voice and video calling. RetroShare is a
          bit more complex to use than some alternatives, and the UI is quite *retro*,
          so may not be appropriate for a non-technical team.

      wordOfWarning: |
        - Having many extensions installed raises entropy, causing your fingerprint to be more unique, hence making tracking easier.
        - Much of the functionality of the above addons can be applied without installing anything, by configuring browser settings yourself. For Firefox this is done in the user.js
        - Be careful when installing unfamiliar browser add-ons, since some can compromise your security and privacy. At the time of writing, the above list were all open source, verified and 'safe' extensions.
        - In most situations, only a few of the above extensions will be needed in combination.
        - See the [arkenfox wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions) for more information on the obsolescence and purposelessness of many popular extensions, and why you may only need a very limited set.
